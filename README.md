# Strike Index Estimation Using a Convolutional Neural Network with a Single, Shoe-Mounted Inertial Sensor
By Tian Tan and Zachary Strout

## Sensor
IMU operating at 200 Hz should be attached to the dorsum surface of the shoe.

## Architecture Definition
The model architecture is defined in [ProcessorSICrossVali.py](ProcessorSICrossVali.py), function "define_cnn_model".

## Publication
The publication is currently under review, and [here is the preprint](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4021993).
